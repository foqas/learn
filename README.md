## Why Open Source

Learning Management Systems (LMS) are essential technologies for modern education. However, many high-quality LMS solutions are often locked behind costly paywalls. At Foqas, we believe education should be equitable and accessible to everyone. That’s why we’re committed to releasing a powerful, open source LMS that anyone can use, modify, and improve — breaking down barriers to quality education worldwide.
